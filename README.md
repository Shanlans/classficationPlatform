# S-Y 
A easy-use classification platform for quick verification and iteration. The current model was designed for simple image classification
which was stacked by S-Y modules.

Basically the S-Y module consists of convolution layer which have several addition options including batch normalization, bias,
scale factor and drop out. So we can construct a CNN architecture in one line.
